        <div class="paragraph">This was my final project for the WDI program at General Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;My idea for this project was to allow individual users to create a virtual wine cellar in order to keep an online inventory for the collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;After creating an accout, the user would create their virtual wine cellar by naming it, and adding an image.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they are able to add and remove bottles as their collection grows.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This application helped solidify my understanding of Ruby on Rails after working with it on several other projects.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">This was my first time working on a group project for this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also my first time working with a UX designer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the four developers we decided to break into a pair on the front-end and a pair working on the back-end.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on the front-end team and got to collaborate closely with our UX designer, which I found particularly rewarding because I have a great interest in design as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also enjoyed having two people working on the front end so that we could pair program.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">I learned a lot during this project, mainly about working with a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;We used Git to manage our workflow, with everyone being able to push as a collaborator since we were all working in different areas.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">This was my first attempt at a Rails app.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really learned a lot about Rails during this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;From setting the app up from scratch, to MVC.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also learned a lot about time management and planning.</div>
